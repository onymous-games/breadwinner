Bots:
1. Drone
1. Harvester
1. Locust
1. Soldier
1. Shield
1. Factory Error

On your Turn:
1. Move/Activate bots on the map
1. Move/Activate bots in Bot-factories
1. Build Bots
1. Deactivate Bots

Handy tips:
- Moving a Shield to the rival's Delivery tile prevents everything except a Soldier from leaving the factory
- A bot must end its turn in a way which leaves no more than two bots on any tile.
- Use the BotFactory distances to your advantage. Production/Defensive bots often travel a shorter distance than offensive bots.
