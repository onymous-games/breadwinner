Bots:
1. SeedBot
1. HarvesterBot
1. LocustBot
1. SoldierBot
1. ShieldBot
1. Factory Error

On your Turn:
1. Move/Activate bots on the map
1. Move/Activate bots in Bot-factories
1. Build Bots
1. Deactivate Bots

Handy tips:
- Moving a ShieldBot to the enemy's starting zone prevents everything except a SoldierBot from leaving the factory
- A bot must end its turn in a way which leaves no more than two bots on any tile.
- Use the BotFactory distances to your advantage. Production/Defensive bots often travel a shorter distance than offensive bots.
