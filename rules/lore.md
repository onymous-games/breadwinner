# Bot Dictionary

## Drone

A small, flying bot equipped with a single bread seed. That's right, in the future, you don't bake bread. You grow it.

## Harvester

A large, truck-like bot equipped with two harvesting prongs attached to the front and a storage area in the back. It almost looks like an over-sized, robot scarab beetle with sharp mandibles and tough armor.

## Locust

Locusts are swarms of flying nanobots filled with various hazardous chemicals designed to keep the rival company from being able to harvest any bread.

## Soldier
Looks something like a hovering magic wand - one end for the components and the other for a series of coils. Designed to move swiftly toward any bot that needs to be deactivated and deliver an electromagnetic pulse targeted at the bot's core. Ironically, delivering this pulse deactivates the Soldier as well, which is why the designers have taken extra care to strip out all resources possible from the design.

## Shield

Shields look like slender pillars with legs and arms. When the Shield turns itself on by using an arm to press the "On" button, the legs dig deep into the ground and a beam of light shoots from the top. A protective bubble of liquid polymers forms around the Shield and other bots in the vicinity. This liquid is tuned to the factories from which it came so that friendly units pass through the bubble, but rival bots are pushed away.

## Research & Development

All assembly lines fail at some point. Even ones controlled by machines. My theory is that the robot scientists sometimes want cute little robot pets and just claim they're Research & Developments... At least that would explain why a sixth of the robots seem to come out "wrong."
