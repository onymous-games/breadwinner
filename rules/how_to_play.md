# Storyline

In a not-so-distant future all food production is controlled by machines. The two of you play as rival companies deploying automated bots to take control of the land and produce as much bread as possible until one company produces all the bread in the world. *cue maniacal laughter*

# Goal of the game

Gain all the bread tokens to become the Bread Winner!

- Use Drones to plant seeds. 
- Transport and unload the seeds using a Harvester. 
- Use Locusts and Soldiers to prevent your rival from making progress.
- Use Shields to protect your bots, harvests and tiles.

# Game Pieces

- 8 BotFactory tiles (4 for each player)
- 4 Land tiles
- 2 Delivery tiles
- 12 Loaves of bread
- 16 6-sided Dice; each player gets 8 dice of a single color
- 4 Poison Condition chips
- 10 Crop chips

# Game Setup

1. Sit across from your opponent and lay out your BotFactory tiles in a row in front of you. These BotFactories are numbered from left-to-right 1, 2, 3, and 4. The number correlates to how many spaces you can move a bot on the map.
1. Pick your color set of 8 dice. These represent the bots you build and deploy.
1. Lay out the tiles in rows: 1 Delivery, 2 Land, 2 Land, 1 Delivery. This becomes your map.
1. Place the Crop chips face-down so that you can't see the numbers and shuffle.
1. Place the Poison Condition chips next to the Crop chips.
1. Decide a spot for the "Discarded Harvest" pile, which is where used Crop chips will go.
1. Place the 12 Loaves of bread on the other side of the map, opposite from the Crop chips.

## The First Turn

The first turn is no different than any other except that there are no existing bots to move on the map or BotFactories. Each player rolls their dice to build bots.

The first player rolls their dice, decides one or more bots to build, and places them on their BotFactory tiles. Only one bot can occupy each BotFactory tile. 

Where you place your bots correlates to how far they can move on the map. The higher the BotFactory number, the further along the map a bot can move. Example: A Drone placed on the BotFactory 4 tile can move up to 4 times.

Then, The second player rolls their dice and places them on their own BotFactory tiles. The second player has the advantage of knowing what the first player is likely to do and can strategically place their own bots accordingly. 

The difference between the first turn and the rest of the game is that each player is only placing bots onto their BotFactory tiles.

After each player has built bots, it is the first player's turn again.

# On your turn you can:

1. FIRST Move OR take an action with each bot on the map.
2. THEN move any bots from the BotFactory tiles on to the map.
3. THEN build new bots and place them on your BotFactory tiles.
4. FINALLY deactivate any of your own bots to go into your dice pile.

> Notes: 
> - You may skip any phase of your turn, but you may not reorder your turn. For example: you cannot deactivate any bot early to add to your dice pile when building new bots.
> - You cannot change actions or movements of the bots on the map after you have started moving bots from the BotFactories. 

## Move or take an action with bots on Delivery and Land tiles

### Movement

Any bot on a Delivery tile or Land tile may make a single movement to a Land or Delivery tile that:
- Is orthogonally adjacent (up/down/left/right - no diagonal movement)
- Has less than two bots
- Is without a rival Shield

### Taking Actions

Any bot on the map that has not yet moved this turn may take an action according to its bot type.

## Move bots from Factory tiles

Any bot in your BotFactories may move onto the map.

The following additional rules apply for movement when moving a bot from a BotFactory:
- Bots move according to their BotFactory number. 

Examples:
- A bot placed on BotFactory 1 can move only 1 space, onto the Delivery Tile.
- A bot placed on BotFactory 2 can move 2 spaces.
- A bot placed on BotFactory 3 can move 3 spaces.
- A bot placed on BotFactory 4 can move up to 4 spaces including the rival Delivery tile.

> Notes: 
> - A bot does not have to go the full distance of their factory number.
> - A bot may be left on it's BotFactory tile to be used on the next turn.
> - Bots may move through tiles occupied by two other friendly bots as long as they stop on a tile which has less than two bots.

## Build new bots

Roll the dice in your pile which are not in a BotFactory or on the map. The face-up numbers correspond to the bots you may build this turn. Bots can only be added to an empty BotFactory tile.

Bots:
1. Drone - plants a seed
1. Harvester - collects the seed and delivers the harvest
1. Locust - poisons the seed or harvest
1. Soldier - neutralizes rival bots
1. Shield - protects a tile from rival bots
1. Research & Development - dice is returned to your pile. *See Bot Abilities -> Research & Development for special circumstances*

## Deactivate friendly bots

Deactivate any bot on the map or on a BotFactory tile by returning it to your dice pile. These dice may be re-rolled on your next turn.

# Bot Abilities

## Drone

### Plant 

Requirements:
- Drone must be on a Land tile
- Land tile must not have a planted (face-down) crop

On a Land tile without a planted crop, place a face-down Crop chip and deactivate the Drone.

> Note: If there are no Crop chips in the Crop chip pile, reclaim all Crop chips from the Discarded Harvest pile, place them face-down, mix these up and select one.

### Restore The Soil

Requirements:
- Tile must have the Poisoned Condition chip

Spend the Drone's battery restoring the poisoned ground so that a new Drone can plant on this ground again. Deactivate the Drone and remove the Poisoned Condition chip from the tile.

## Harvester

### Harvest

Requirements:
- Must not already be carrying a harvest.
- Current tile must have a Crop chip.

On a tile with a Crop chip, turn the Crop chip face-up and place it on top of the Harvester. The chip will now move with the bot.

The bot is now considered to be carrying a harvest.

### Steal a Harvest

Requirements: 
- Must not be carrying a harvest.
- Must be occupying a tile with another Harvester carrying a harvest

On a tile with a rival Harvester, use your own Harvester's mandibles to rip off the storage of the other. Move the harvest to your own Harvester. The rival Harvester remains on the tile.

Your Harvester is now considered to be carrying a harvest.

### Unload

> Note: A Harvester may unload even if it has moved this turn.

Requirements:
- Must be carrying a harvest
- Must move to your Delivery tile (cannot unload on opponent's Delivery tile)
- A harvest cannot be delivered if the Delivery tile has two other bots (one other bot is fine)

Look at the number on the Crop chip and take that number of Loaves of Bread from the center pile. If there are not enough in the center, take the remaining Loaves of Bread from your opponent. (Yes, steal the bread if your Crop chip number demands it). Place the spent Crop chip in the Discarded Harvest pile, and deactivate the Harvester. If you now have all Loaves of Bread, you win!

## Locust

### Poison Land

> This is an offensive action and can be played on the same turn that the bot moves.

Requirements:
- Must be on a Land tile
- Tile must not already be poisoned
- Tile cannot be guarded by a Shield

Use the chemicals in the Locust to poison the ground. 
Deactivate the Locust and add the Poison Condition chip to that tile.

This Land tile will remain poisoned until a Drone performs the action: Restore the Soil.

### Meltdown

> This is an offensive action and can be played on the same turn that the bot moves.

Requirements:
- Tile must have a Harvester

Destroy the Harvester and it's harvest. Deactivate the Locust and Harvester bots and move the Crop chip to the Discarded Harvest pile.

## Soldier

### Pulse

> This is an offensive action and can be played on the same turn that the bot moves.

Requirements:
- A tile with a bot

Take aim and shoot the electromagnetic gun toward a bot. If there is a rival Shield on the tile, the Pulse only deactivates the Shield. Deactivate the Soldier and the destroyed bot. Only one bot can be destroyed per Soldier.

> Notes: 
> - A Soldier may move onto any available tile without engaging Pulse.
> - Other bots may land on a tile with a Soldier and the Solider cannot use Pulse until it's next turn.
> - If a Soldier deactivates a Harvester carrying a harvest and the tile the Harvester stands on is an empty Land tile, the Crop chip is placed face-down onto the Land tile. If the Harvester stood on a Delivery tile or a Land tile with an existing harvest, the Crop chip is moved to the Discarded Harvest pile.

## Shield

Requirements: 
- Cannot move to a tile with a rival bot
- Cannot move to a tile with a friendly Shield

Guards against rival bots from entering the tile and becomes the target of any Soldier's Pulse attack.

The Shield immediately protects the tile it lands on.

## Research & Development

Typically when you roll Research & Development, the die is unusable and is returned to your dice pile for the next turn. 

If you roll three Research & Development in a single roll, you may spend them to build a single bot of your choosing: Select a die and change the number face-up to the bot you want, then place this bot in an empty BotFactory. The remaining two dice return to your dice pile for the next turn.

Similarly, if you roll Research & Development six times in a single roll, you may spend them to build two bots of your choosing.
